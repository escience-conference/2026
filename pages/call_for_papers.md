<h2>22nd IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience’26) Call for Papers</h2>

The 22nd IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience’26) will be held in Naples from September 28 to October 2, 2026.

eScience studies, enacts, and improves the ongoing process of innovation in computationally intensive or data-intensive research methods; typically, this is carried out collaboratively, often using distributed computing infrastructure. eScience encompasses all fields of research and addresses all stages of the research lifecycle, from formulation of the research questions, through large-scale simulations and data analytics, scientific discovery, up to long-term sharing, publication, reusing, and reapplying of the results, data, as well as the relevant tools, processes, and knowledge.

eScience’26 welcomes paper submissions for its technical program. The conference will be an interdisciplinary forum for researchers, developers, and users of applications and enabling IT technologies. The conference welcomes conceptualization, implementation, and experience contributions that will allow and drive innovation in data- and compute-intensive research. eScience covers all disciplines, from the physical and biological sciences to the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Infrastructure and technologies can span a broad spectrum, including HPC, cloud, IoT, and artificial intelligence and machine learning methods.

Submissions may include all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools, with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. Ideal papers involve the interplay between applications and infrastructure technologies, with an emphasis on novelty in one or both.

Topics of interest related to eScience also include, but are not limited to:

- Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, generative AI, and large language models are/applicable in science
- Research computing cyberinfrastructure (e.g., cloud, cluster, HPC, supercomputer)
- Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific software, data, workflows, and models
- Reproducible and replicable eScience
- Translational research in computer and computational sciences
- Continuum computing: convergence between cloud computing, edge computing, and/or the Internet of Things (IoT)
- Education and e-Science
- Collaborative, reproducible, and replicable eScience
- Science gateways, data portals, and digital repositories
- Resource management and scheduling
- Programming paradigms and models
- Real-time (time-sensitive) computing (e.g., for scientific instruments)
- Automation and event-based computing
- Big data stacks and significant data ecosystems
- File and storage systems, I/O, and data management
- Scientific applications, algorithms, tools, and technologies
- Scientific workflows and distributed computing paradigms (e.g., FaaS)
- Blockchain technologies in science
- Fault tolerance, resilience, and security

The conference is now soliciting **full papers (8 pages excluding references)** that present previously unpublished research achievements or eScience experiences and solutions.

Submitted papers should use the IEEE 8.5×11 manuscript guidelines: double-column text using single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5×11-inch pages. All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Selected full papers will receive a slot for an oral presentation. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted full papers will be published in the IEEE conference proceedings. Rejected full papers can be resubmitted as posters or workshop presentations.

Submitted papers may also be posted on preprint servers (e.g., arXiv).

At least one author of each accepted paper must register as an author at the full registration rate. Each author registration applies to only one accepted submission. Note. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of the paper. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be determined, accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. Authors are fully responsible for all content they submit.

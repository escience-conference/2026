<h2>Call for Workshops</h2>
The 22nd IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience’26) will be held in **Naples, Italy from September 28 to October 2, 2026**.

eScience studies, enacts, and improves the ongoing process of innovation in computationally intensive or data-intensive research methods; typically, this is carried out collaboratively, often using distributed computing infrastructure. eScience encompasses all fields of research and addresses all stages of the research lifecycle, from formulation of the research questions, through large-scale simulations and data analytics, scientific discovery, up to long-term sharing, publication, reusing, and reapplying of the results, data, as well as the relevant tools, processes, and knowledge.
Workshops offer a platform for valuable discussions among researchers and practitioners, focusing on key topics and emerging research areas in all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools, with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. Ideal papers involve the interplay between applications and infrastructure technologies, with an emphasis on novelty in one or both.
Workshops typically feature a blend of invited talks, peer-reviewed papers, panel discussions, and work-in-progress presentations. Workshop organizers are encouraged to structure their sessions for an audience of approximately 20-40 participants, with flexibility for either a full-day or half-day format, depending on interest and space availability.
We welcome proposals for workshops on new, innovative topics as well as submissions to continue successful seminars from previous years. Note that proceedings of eScience workshops will be published by the IEEE in dedicated proceedings. The selected workshops will be held on the **first day of the conference (September 28)**.

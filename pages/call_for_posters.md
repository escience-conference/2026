<h2>Call for Posters</h2>

The 22nd IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience’26) to be held in **Naples, Italy on September 28-October 2, 2026**, welcomes poster submissions for the technical program.

eScience 2026 provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers, developers, and users of eScience applications and enabling IT technologies. Its objective is to promote and encourage all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools, with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. The conference welcomes conceptualization, implementation, and experience contributions enabling and driving innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all disciplines, from the physical and biological sciences to the social sciences, arts, and humanities; encompassing artificial intelligence and machine learning methods; and targeting a broad spectrum of architectures, including HPC, cloud, and IoT.
The conference is soliciting poster paper submissions (up to 2 pages, in IEEE format) showcasing early-stage results and innovations.
All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted poster papers will be published in the conference proceedings through the IEEE Digital Library. Shortened versions of rejected full papers can be resubmitted for a poster presentation.

<h2>Call for Tutorials</h2>

The 22nd IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience’26) will be held in **Naples, Italy from September 28 to October 2, 2026**.

eScience studies, enacts, and improves the ongoing process of innovation in computationally intensive or data-intensive research methods; typically, this is carried out collaboratively, often using distributed computing infrastructure. eScience encompasses all fields of research and addresses all stages of the research lifecycle, from formulation of the research questions, through large-scale simulations and data analytics, scientific discovery, up to long-term sharing, publication, reusing, and reapplying of the results, data, as well as the relevant tools, processes, and knowledge.
The tutorial program is intended to teach new and/or state-of-the-art tools and techniques relevant to the eScience audience, disseminate information to conference attendees on recently emerging topics and trends, or provide surveys and overviews of related digital technologies.
We encourage all submissions within the conference's scope, particularly those with a practical (hands-on) component that help attendees learn new eScience technologies. We also encourage submissions that disseminate new eScience technologies to a more diverse audience.

description: >
  IEEE eScience 2026 brings together leading interdisciplinary research communities, developers, and users of eScience
  applications and enabling IT technologies. The objective of the eScience Conference is to promote and encourage all
  aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools with a strong focus on
  practical solutions and challenges. The eScience conference interprets eScience in its broadest meaning that enables
  and improves innovation in data- and compute-intensive research across all domain sciences, ranging from traditional
  areas in physics and earth sciences to more recent fields such as social sciences, arts and humanities, and
  artificial intelligence for a wide variety of target architectures, including HPC, cloud, and IoT infrastructures.
  <br/><br />
  The 22nd IEEE International Conference on eScience is co-located with the 7th [Global Research Platform Workshop](https://www.theglobalresearchplatform.net)
  (7GRP). Both audiences share common interests, content, and culture. Co-location provides attendees with the option
  to register for both events.
